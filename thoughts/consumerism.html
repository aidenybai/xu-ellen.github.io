        <h5>consumerism</h5>

        <p>we live in a consumerist society, buying, buying, buying, browsing, satisfying this animalistic hunger and craving in us abstracted upon the fundamental need for survival. this is hunting, gone overkill.</p>
        <p>we puncture holes inside ourselves and fill them up with wrappers. we carve spaces in our bodies to fit homes made of cut tags and cardboard boxes. we shape our minds into abstract realities of holidays and mimetic theory and standards of happiness.</p>
        <p>i am society checking out. i am left with this craving, like i have dug a hole for myself too deep to crawl out of. so i call this place home, and i fill it with all these things i want, and i want, and they tell me i want, and none of which give me anything i really need.</p>
