        <h5>mountain</h5>


<p>I stare at the blinking light reflected back, like stars twinkling from scraps of metal and red tiled rooftops. And I wonder: there’s someone in that car winding along the sea of traffic on the I-5 North, there’s someone in those neatly lined houses cooking or drinking or thinking about work, and then there’s someone next to them thinking a completely different set of things but in the same locale, and the more you zoom in to each unit of area from up top the more you realize how much more you can zoom in. How they probably don’t even know I exist, having hiked up this mountain with beads of sweat in my eyebrow and thinking about their very lives. And maybe there’s someone out there thinking about me right now, maybe I don’t even know them, maybe right at this moment when I’m wondering about the guy in the ice cream truck whose music can be heard from the mountaintop he is wondering if there’s a girl up there who wants some ice cream too.</p>

<p>I think about the meaning of all of this, of the cityscape and to the left all the mountains and how blue they look the further out you observe until it fades into the ocean. Was it more beautiful before? Why do we build things that are temporarily reversing entropy locally, knowing that we are diverging into chaos, that our civilization is marked and only temporary?</p>

<p>I think about someone standing here, sometime before me, thinking these borrowed thoughts and wondering why.

<p>And then we hike back down. The car pulls back in reverse, we retrace our route back home, and I sit back at my desk. Wondering if there’s someone on the mountaintop staring down and thinking about a projection of me, too.</p>
