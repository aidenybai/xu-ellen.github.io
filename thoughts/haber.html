        <h5>haber</h5>

        <p>he was the monster who fed the world. who lifted thousands from famines with ammonia fertilizer but turned warzones into wastelands, skin into rotting flesh. who turned lungs into rivers of suffocation with white, blue, green, and yellow crosses. who shed tears for human life yet was the merciless plague of wwii. unblinkingly.</p>
        <p>she was the pacifist who died in his shadow. the hand was hers but the bullet which penetrated her chest was his. her death was at the hands of his weapon, the chlorine gas at ypres, and her soul was at the soldiers on their knees who died by haber’s chemistry.</p>
        <p>and when her body sank into the soil in her son’s arms, haber vacated her funeral for the battlefield on the eastern front. to him, she was just another life at his feet. to him, another chemistry experiment gone wrongfully right.</p>
